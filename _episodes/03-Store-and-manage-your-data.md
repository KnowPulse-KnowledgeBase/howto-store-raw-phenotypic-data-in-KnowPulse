## Data backup
[Data backup function](https://knowpulse.usask.ca/phenotypes/raw/backup) (needs login to access) allows you to backup multiple versions of your raw phenotypic data files into the KnowPulse during the growing season. 

**Please note, your data file needs to be saved as Excel Workbooks (.xlsx).**

To back up your data, first, select the project that corresponds to data collection spreadsheet file. Then drag and drop your file to the File Drop Zone Area or click choose file to launch file browser window. A text box for describing data collection in its current state is provided to make it easier to reference back to if needed. You can view all your files in **Manage My Files** section.
