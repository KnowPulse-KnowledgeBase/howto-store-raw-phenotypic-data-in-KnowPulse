Before you start collecting phenotypic data in your trial, please get in touch with us via ![Screenshot of main code listing](../fig/howto-upload-raw-phenotypic-data.10.png) to setup your project in KnowPulse. One of us will help you to set up all the details and register you under your project. Meanwhile, we need to collect detailed information about your project, including **Project Name** and **Project Description**. After that, you will be able to access the following information:

- Information in text and photo format on how data should be collected for each trait.
