Before you start collecting phenotypic data in your trail, please get in touch with us via ![Screenshot of main code listing](../fig/howto-upload-raw-phenotypic-data.10.png) to setup your project in KnowPulse.  One of us will help to set up all the details and register you under your project. We will need to collect trait description from your project with all the following details:data data storing 

Once you have a properly setup project in KnowPulse, you will be able to access the following information:




- Access to text and photo on how data should be collected for each trait;
- A page to download data collection spreadsheet file pre-filled with project specific traits and formatted in way expected by KnowPulse/module. (This file is used to record data);
- A space in KnowPulse that you can backup spreadsheet file and access backed up files anywhere;


The trait description step can also be finished during data uploading. Click [here](https://knowpulse.usask.ca/portal/sites/default/files/tutorial_files/rawpheno_videos/rawpheno_upload_new_traits.mp4) to learn more details. 

Now the raw phenotypic importer should be able to generate a customized data collection spreadsheet for your data. In the next episode, you will learn how to enter your data in the category column headers.
