Once you have your data file ready to be uploaded, please get in touch with us via ![Screenshot of main code listing](../fig/howto-upload-raw-phenotypic-data.10.png) One of us will help to set up all the details and register you under your project. We will need to collect trait description from your project with all the following details:

- **Name**
- **Trait Rep/Stages**
- **Unit**
- **Definition**

The trait description step can also be finished during data uploading. Click [here](https://knowpulse.usask.ca/portal/sites/default/files/tutorial_files/rawpheno_videos/rawpheno_upload_new_traits.mp4) to learn more details. 

Now the raw phenotypic importer should be able to generate a customized data collection spreadsheet for your data. In the next episode, you will learn how to enter your data in the category column headers.
